In this project I built a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the
population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block
groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short. The data is outdated but i really enjoyed working on the regression model!
